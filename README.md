# Foundation of Object-oriented Languages

This is an implementation of the type checking algorithms in Kim Bruce's
book *Foundation of Object-oriented Languages*.

This is a hobby project for me and any errors in these algorithms are mine
alone and you should consult the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Object-Oriented-Languages-Types-Semantics-ebook/dp/B00MHAV1GS/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Foundations+of+Of+Object-oriented+languages&qid=1572209999&sr=8-3) instead.
